# Day 1.  Is it hot in here or is it me?
I feel the pressure.  I need to start small.  Avoid complexity and make things happen.  My first goal will be to create a database with one table (tbl_tasks) and four fields (tsk_ID, tsk_priority, tsk_task, tsk_status).  

I won't put limits for now but in the future... oh, there will be limits.  This is the proof of concept though.  Why should I punish myself?

# Day 1.  A little later.
So it's not that hot in here.  I am going to store the data in a text file (maybe json if I feel fancy) in the proof of concept.  MariaDB is out (for now).  I want to reduce external dependencies to the greatest extent practical.  This doesn't bother me so don't let it bother you.
