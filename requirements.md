# Facts
Projects have tasks and tasks have subtasks.
Subtasks can be marked as complete independently.
Tasks can (but don't have to) be closed by completing all subtasks.
If a subtask is selected for print then the Task and Project can (but don't have to) be printed as well.

The tasks, subtasks, and notes are stored in tables in MariaDB.
Interaction with the database will be Python3 and eventually a web front-end.

# Security
Database security will be established.  
Security will be applied at the user interface (Python CLI, Python GUI, and Web Forms).
